# WorldPlanner

idk, i wrote this when i was like 17 because i wanted to build stuff in Breaworlds without actually having to buy the blocks first lol. it’s basically a world editor that runs in your browser. The project actually contains all assets from back then 2024.

everything is in one giant JS file because i didn’t care about “clean code” back then. if you’re looking for professional software architecture… this is not it goodluck.

you can find a running example of WorldPlanner blazing fast, here:  
https://bun.cytric.nl/WorldPlanner/index.html

## what is this?
WorldPlanner is a world planner for Breaworlds. you can:
- place blocks on a 100x60 grid
- render images directly into the world (no idea why i added this, but it’s cool)
- save your builds as JSON files to share or load later
- export your world as a PNG to show it off
- zoom in/out and scroll around like a normal person

## Fishgems Calculator
Need to know the value of your fish in Breaworlds? The Fishgems Calculator helps you convert your fish to gems and World Locks. It's a handy tool for traders and players alike!
You can access it directly by opening `Fishgems/index.html`.
You can also find a running example here: https://bun.cytric.nl/Fishgems also its a bit outdated but its easily updateable, did you make a accurate version? you can message me on hello@semmyverdonschot.com and I will host it for free.

## how to run it
literally just open `index.html`.  
no npm install, no build steps, no server. just pure vanilla JS and some CSS.

## how to use it
- **left click** to place blocks  
- **right click** to erase (or use the seed/eraser tool)  
- **ctrl + scroll** to zoom  
- the search bar at the bottom is actually pretty decent for finding blocks

## why?
because i i idk 

peace.
